Most popular early chatbots include Eliza from 1966 as well as Parry who used pattern matching techniques based on keywords or phrases, creating an illusion of understanding.[9] However the real breakthrough came when a man named Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA in 1967 using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms. The program was able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a human by responding appropriately based on keywords or phrases present within their input.[9] Since then, chatbots have evolved significantly through NLP systems which allow them greater understanding of the user's intent from their speech patterns as well as more accurate language processing.\nEliza was notable for its ability to mimic conversations that users might engage in with a human being on an average day such as small talk or getting directions.[10] This illusion, known now by most people simply as \"chatting\", is achieved through the use of keywords and phrases which can be recognized within user input.
